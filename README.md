# Phototransduction
This is my matlab implementation and UI of the model
described in Gross, Pugh and Burns
(Spatiotemporal cGMP dynamics in living mouse rods, Biophys J. 2012 Apr 18;102(8):1775-84. doi: 10.1016/j.bpj.2012.03.035.).
A partial differential equation in x and t is solved using matlab functions, and this gives the same
solution as NMOL (by Dr. Schiesser)
This matlab program has options to select variations of the model.

This program is intended for research or recreational purposes only, and not for clinical or diagnostic use.
